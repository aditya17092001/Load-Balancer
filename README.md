# ‚öñÔ∏è Java Load Balancer

A multithreaded **Load Balancer** implementation in Java that distributes incoming client requests across multiple backend servers using different load-balancing strategies.  
It also includes a background **Health Checker** that continuously monitors server health.

## üß± System Design Overview

### üèóÔ∏è High-Level Design (HLD)

**Components:**
1. **Client** ‚Äì Sends simulated requests to the load balancer.
2. **Load Balancer** ‚Äì Routes requests to backend servers based on selected strategy.
3. **Servers** ‚Äì Backend servers that process incoming requests.
4. **Health Checker** ‚Äì Periodically checks server health.

**Flow:**
1. Client sends request to Load Balancer.
2. Load Balancer chooses a healthy server based on the strategy.
3. Request is forwarded asynchronously using a thread pool.
4. Server handles the request and updates its connection count.
5. HealthChecker runs in the background to mark servers as healthy/unhealthy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Low-Level Design (LLD)

#### Core Classes
| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `Server` | Represents a backend server with active connection tracking and health status. |
| `LoadBalancer` | Manages servers, applies strategy, and forwards requests asynchronously. |
| `LoadBalancingStrategy` | Interface for implementing different routing strategies. |
| `RoundRobin`, `LeastConnection`, `IPHash` | Different implementations of `LoadBalancingStrategy`. |
| `HealthChecker` | Periodically pings all servers and updates their health status. |
| `Main` | Initializes the system, starts threads, and simulates client requests. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The `Main` class initializes three backend servers:  
   `http://localhost:8001`, `http://localhost:8002`, and `http://localhost:8003`.
2. You can switch between load-balancing algorithms by changing this line in `Main.java`:

```
LoadBalancingStrategy strategy = new RoundRobin();
```

3. The LoadBalancer forwards incoming requests to servers using a fixed-size thread pool.
4. The HealthChecker runs continuously in the background to verify server health.

## üß† Example Output
```
[pool-1-thread-3] Client 192.168.1.2 -> http://localhost:8001
Server Status: http://localhost:8001, ActiveConnections=3, Healthy=true
........................................
http://localhost:8002 server is Healthy
http://localhost:8003 server is Unhealthy
All requests processed.
```

## üß∞ Prerequisites
Java 17+

Any IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code) or command-line setup

Optionally, mock backend servers running on ports 8001‚Äì8003

To start mock servers quickly (for demo), run:

```
python3 -m http.server 8001
python3 -m http.server 8002
python3 -m http.server 8003
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Program

Copy code
javac com/LB/*.java com/LB/Algorithms/*.java
java com.LB.Main
üõë Stopping Servers
If you want to stop mock servers manually:

Windows:
To kill the ports
```
netstat -ano | findstr :8001
taskkill /PID <pid> /F
```

## üß© Future Enhancements
Add weighted round robin algorithm

Support HTTPS backend servers

Introduce rate limiting and retry logic

Expose a REST API for dynamic server registration
